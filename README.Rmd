# canwqdata

An R `r emo::ji("package")`  to download open water quality data from Environment and Climate Change Canada's [National Long-term Water Quality Monitoring Data](http://donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/substances/monitor/national-long-term-water-quality-monitoring-data/).

### Features

This package is designed to get Canadian Water Quality Monitoring data into R quickly and easily. You can get data from a single monitoring station, multiple stations, or from an entire basin. Note that current version of this package can only retrieve data from BC, not from other provinces.

### Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("bcgov/canwqdata")
```

### Usage

First load the package:

```{r}
library(canwqdata)
library(tidyverse)
```


The first thing you will probably want to do is get a list of the available BC sites and associated metadata:

```{r}
sites <- wq_sites()

sites
```

Then get some data from a particular station:

`BC08EF0001` is a site in BC called *`r tools::toTitleCase(tolower(sites$SITE_NAME[sites$SITE_NO == "BC08EF0001"]))`*

```{r}
skeena_river <- wq_site_data("BC08EF0001")

skeena_river
```

We can also get data from more than one station:

```{r}
wq_site_data(c("BC08NF0001", "BC08NM0160"))
```

Or an entire basin:

The basins are in the `PEARSEDA` column of the data.frame returned by `wq_sites()`:

```{r}
basins <- sort(unique(sites$PEARSEDA))
basins

fraser <- wq_basin_data("FRASER-LOWER MAINLAND")
```

Do some quick summary stats of the fraser dataset:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

fraser %>% 
  group_by(SITE_NO) %>% 
  summarise(first_date = min(DATE_TIME_HEURE), 
            latest_date = max(DATE_TIME_HEURE), 
            n_params = length(unique(VARIABLE)), 
            total_samples = n())
```


We can also look at metadata that helps us understand what is in the different columns.

`wq_params()` returns a list of water quality parameters (variables), and related data - units, methods, codes, etc:

```{r}
params <- wq_params()
glimpse(params)

# wq_param_desc shows the column headings (in all other tables) and what they mean
wq_data_desc() %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Let's look at Total Nitrogen in the Fraser basin:

```{r}
fraser_n_total <- fraser %>% filter(VARIABLE == "NITROGEN TOTAL")
```

Now lets do some plotting - plot Total Nitrogen over time at all the sites, 
(plot it on a log scale so that they all fit)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(fraser_n_total, aes(x = DATE_TIME_HEURE, y = VALUE_VALEUR)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.4, alpha = 0.4, colour = "purple") + 
  facet_wrap(~ SITE_NO) + 
  scale_y_log10()
```


It's also possible to download data from an entire BC:

```{r}
bc_sites <- sites %>% 
  pull(SITE_NO)

all_bc_data <- wq_site_data(bc_sites)

glimpse(all_bc_data)
```
